# DESCRIPTION
Test of `DeBug.cpp` with an active WiFi connection,
thereby enabling `telnet`.
This should work anyway but will given you a warning if you attempt to use `telnet` features.
This configuration is fine for any application that doesn't plan to use `telnet`.

If you want to use `telnet`, you must start-up WiFi.
For WiFi, the class `WiFiHandler.cpp` is preferred but not required.
