## ESP32

## DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT DOIT
There are two versions of this board, with 30 and with 38 pins.
Both work in a similar way.
I prefer the version with 38 pin since its breadboard friendly, and a result cost more.

### DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT DOIT V1
### MELIFE ESP-32S
**NOTE: Not Breadboard Friendly!**
It has 15+15 pins.
I purchased MELIFE ESP-32S (aka ESP-WROOM-32, nodemcu-32s) Development Board
**NOTE:** It has 'ESP32 DEVKITV1' printed on the back of the board

```

### DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT DOIT V2
### KeeYees ESP32S Dev Board
### HiLetgo ESP-WROOM-32
This is the 19+19 pin version.

```

## ESP32 WROOM Lolin32 Lite
Has Lithium battery interface
It has 13+13 pins.
[pinout for ESP32 WeMos Lolin32 Lite][12]

The Wemos LOLIN32 Lite board is discontinued, but several clones are still being offered
(e.g. AITRIP).

**Not** the same as FireBeetle ESP32 IoT Microcontroller
[pinout for DFRobot FireBeetle Board ESP32-E][26]
It has 18+14 pins.

It is equipped with a DFRobot GDI(General Display Interface)
to connect screens like [DFR0664][27]/[DFR0649][28]/[DFR0665][29]/[DFR0669][30]

```bash
# fully qualified board name (FQBN)
FQBN = esp32:esp32:dfrobot_firebeetle2_esp32s3
```

## TinyS2 (ESP32-S2 Board)
To find out what revision TinyS2 you have, look under the USB connector on the back of the board and you will find the P revision.
Mine is P5
Use the Pinout diagram for "revision P3 and newer".
It has 11+12 pins.
[TinyS2 (ESP32-S2 Board)][19]

```bash
# fully qualified board name (FQBN)
FQBN = esp32:esp32:tinys2
```

* The red power LED doesn't light up when running off battery to reduce power consumption.
* The orange charge LED blinks when no battery is connected.
The charge IC canâ€™t tell the difference between a full battery and no battery,
so it cycles between trying to charge and not charge.
(**NOTE:** You can disable the orange status LED by cutting the solder jumper on the back of the TinyS2.)
* The TinyS2 can read an approximate voltage from a connected battery via IO3.
* TinyS2 has the ability to check if a 5V power source is connected to the board
by reading if IO21 is high.
(**NOTE:** This allows you to alter your code when running off battery when you have a 5V source present or not.)


[What is the difference between /dev/ttyUSB and /dev/ttyACM?](https://rfc1149.net/blog/2013/03/05/what-is-the-difference-between-devttyusbx-and-devttyacmx/)
/dev/ttyACM0 is a USB communication device (CDC) of sub-type "abstract control model" (ACM).
/dev/ttyS0 is a hardware serial port - the (typically) 9-pin D connector on the back of your computer.
