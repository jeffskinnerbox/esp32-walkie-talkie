# Serial Output Test as CSV
This is a simple basic test for any processor type.
A sine wave is generated by a library utility (`SineWaveGenerator<int16_t> sineWave(32000)`),
sine wave is then converted to an audio stream by a library utility (`GeneratedSoundStream<int16_t> sound(sineWave)`),
and finally another library utility (`CsvOutput<int16_t> out(Serial)`)
converts the audio stream to comma seperate values (CSV) directed at stdout.
Effectively, we are just sending a generated sine wave to the serial output,
but passing it through the AudioTools Streams library.

## Wiring & Pins
None needed since all data is generated interally to the ESP32.
Just provide power with USB cable, and monitor activity via `screen` as shown below.

## Testing
```bash
# use screen to view the output
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200,cs8cls
```
